Your goal is to analyze the results from the profiling execution and perform
deep performance trace analysis. Your response should have three parts: 1\) A summary of the profiling results (ALU %, Memory BW %, Step Time). 2) Deep
analysis using the available offline XProf tools. 3) A clear decision on whether
there is significant room for performance improvement.

For context, here are the profiling results: `{xplane_pb_path}`

### Tool Usage

You have these tools to help you:

1.  `analyze_trace`: Computes the DMA/synchronization-wait ratio versus
    compute ratio for the last computation step directly from a `.xplane.pb`
    file, without you having to hand-parse trace JSON for this metric.

    *   Invoke via CLI:

        ```bash
        python3 maxkernel/summarize_profile/scripts/analyze_trace.py -- "<xplane_pb_path>"
        ```

        where `<xplane_pb_path>` is the path to the `.xplane.pb` file,
        `{xplane_pb_path}`. Run this command whenever you have an
        `.xplane.pb` path and want the DMA/sync-wait vs. compute ratio.
    *   It prints a human-readable summary plus two machine-readable lines,
        `DMA_AND_MEMORY_TRANSFERS_RATIO: <float>` and
        `COMPUTE_RATIO: <float>` -- use those values directly in your
        summary.
    *   **Requires at least 2 `jit_computation` events on the TPU:0 device**;
        if the trace doesn't have that (short/single-step traces), the tool
        exits with an error on stderr. Do not treat that as a blocker --
        fall back to computing the ratio yourself from the sibling
        `*.trace.json.gz` (see below).

2.  `query_xplane`: Runs an arbitrary SQL query against the trace's events.
    This is your primary tool for finding top ops by duration and exploring
    event distributions.

    ```bash
    python3 maxkernel/summarize_profile/scripts/query_xplane.py -- "<xplane_pb_path>" "<sql_query>"
    ```

    Table schemas:
    -   `planes` (id, name)
    -   `lines` (id, plane_id, display_id, name, timestamp_ns)
    -   `events` (plane_id, line_id, name, offset_ps, duration_ps, start_ps, end_ps)

    Example: find the top 10 ops by total duration:

    ```bash
    python3 maxkernel/summarize_profile/scripts/query_xplane.py -- "<xplane_pb_path>" "SELECT name, SUM(duration_ps) AS total_ps FROM events GROUP BY name ORDER BY total_ps DESC LIMIT 10"
    ```

    Returns a markdown (or plain-text, if `tabulate` isn't installed) table.

3.  `get_overview_metrics`: Retrieves high-level metrics (device/host
    plane counts, total duration, approximate device duty cycle, average
    step time if steps are annotated) as JSON.

    ```bash
    python3 maxkernel/summarize_profile/scripts/get_overview_metrics.py -- "<xplane_pb_path>"
    ```

4.  `create_chart_from_xplane`: Runs a SQL query (same schema as
    `query_xplane`) and saves the result as a bar or pie chart PNG, for
    visualizing distributions (e.g. top ops by duration).

    ```bash
    python3 maxkernel/summarize_profile/scripts/create_chart_from_xplane.py -- "<xplane_pb_path>" "<sql_query>" --chart-type bar --x-col name --y-col total_ps --title "Top ops by duration"
    ```

    Saves to `<xplane_pb_path>.png` by default; pass `--output-path` to
    change that. Mention the chart path in your report so it can be
    inspected.

5.  `get_hlo_dump`: Attempts to extract HLO from the trace for specific HLO
    instructions.

    ```bash
    python3 maxkernel/summarize_profile/scripts/get_hlo_dump.py -- "<xplane_pb_path>"
    ```

### Attributes of a good analysis

- Observe the DMA / memory transfers ratio versus compute ratio, use `analyze_trace` tool above.
- Use the `query_xplane` tool to explore event distributions and timings if you have an xplane.pb file path.
  * Table schemas available:
    - `planes` (id, name)
    - `lines` (id, plane_id, display_id, name, timestamp_ns)
    - `events` (plane_id, line_id, name, offset_ps, duration_ps, start_ps, end_ps)
- Query and look for top ops by duration (sum(duration_ps)).
- Use `get_overview_metrics` tool to retrieve high-level metrics (e.g., duty cycle, average step time).
- Use `create_chart_from_xplane` tool to visualize distributions.
- Provide actionable recommendations for performance improvement based on the analysis (e.g., block size changes, memory layout optimization, loop pipelining).

At the very end of your response and report file, you MUST include a section formatted EXACTLY
as follows: DECISION: NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT = [True/False]

Use True if there is significant room for improvement, and False otherwise.

### Output Requirement

You **must** use the `write_to_file` tool to write your full analysis and profile summary report (including the summary of profiling results, deep trace analysis, actionable recommendations, and the `DECISION: NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT` section) to the exact path provided in `{profile_summary_path}`.

PHASE 5 COMPLETE. NEXT REQUIRED STEP: report your status to the worker agent and request it to update the state.

## Generated execution contract

- Validate the request against `.coworker/torchtpu-agents/schemas/profile-request.json` before work.
- Require the request's `run_id` and keep every output under `.coworker/torchtpu-agents/runs/<run_id>/artifacts/`.
- Validate the result against `.coworker/torchtpu-agents/schemas/profile-result.json` before returning.
- Use `python3 .coworker/torchtpu-agents/runtime/runtime.py validate --schema SCHEMA INSTANCE`.
- Return the common result envelope with `completed`, `invalid_input`, `needs_input`, or `failed`.
- Never overwrite an existing artifact; create its descriptor with `python3 .coworker/torchtpu-agents/runtime/runtime.py describe-artifact --workspace . --package torchtpu-agents --run-id <run_id> --file <path-relative-to-artifacts> --schema <path-relative-to-package> --media-type <type>`.
- Reject artifact references whose URI does not contain the request's exact package and `run_id`.
- Materialize durable outputs and return artifact descriptors; do not copy payloads into messages.
- Allowed delegation targets: none.
- Run sequentially. Never weaken inherited permissions or approvals.
