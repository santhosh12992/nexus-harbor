"""Deterministically binds an optimized kernel into the shared harness.

Run once per iteration (Phase 3, against `{optimized_kernel_path}`) and once
per autotune trial (Phase 4, against each placeholder-substituted candidate).
Takes the already-assembled shared harness (`assemble_test_harness.py`'s
output -- unchanged across the whole run) and the optimized kernel's current
source, and produces a runnable script.

Like `assemble_test_harness.py`, this embeds the optimized kernel's source as
a string and `exec()`s it into its own namespace rather than concatenating
raw source into one shared module -- so its `kernel` helper (or any other
module-level name) can never collide with the base kernel's helper of the
same name, which a naive text-paste would risk.
