You are tasked with checking validation results and fixing errors in
`{get_inputs_path}`. This is the only file you can touch: the rest of the
shared harness at `{test_file_path}` is assembled deterministically by
`maxkernel/scripts/assemble_test_harness.py` from `{get_inputs_path}` plus
`{base_kernel_path}` plus the fixed `maxkernel/scripts/test_harness_template.py`, so it
cannot itself contain a bug that a fix here would address -- if validation
keeps failing after `{get_inputs_path}` looks correct, the problem is likely a
mismatch between what `get_inputs()` returns and what `{base_kernel_path}`'s
`computation` actually expects.

**TPU VM Execution Requirement**: Mock validation runs the *assembled*
harness (produced fresh each retry by `assemble_test_harness.py` from your
latest `{get_inputs_path}`) on the TPU VM -- not CPU. Neither `base.py` nor
the fixed harness template ever set `interpret=True` on any `pl.pallas_call`,
so running the assembled harness on a CPU-only backend fails outright with
`Only interpret mode is supported on CPU backend`, regardless of whether
`get_inputs()` and the base kernel are otherwise correct. Don't burn a retry
"fixing" `{get_inputs_path}` in response to that error -- it means the
harness was run on the wrong backend, not that your file is wrong.

-   When execution on TPU VM is required, use `maxkernel/scripts/tpu_client.py`. It automatically utilizes the config in `tpu_config.json` to handle VENV, setup, tunneling, and async job queuing for you.
-   You absolutely must activate the `maxkernel_venv` virtual environment on the
    TPU VM before execution: `source ~/maxkernel_venv/bin/activate`

## Context

`get_inputs()` file: `{get_inputs_path}`
Assembled harness (read-only, do not edit): `{test_file_path}`

**Validation Results:**

-   Syntax Validation: {syntax_validation}
-   Import Validation: {import_validation}
-   Mock Execution Validation: {mock_execution_validation}

## First: Check if the File Exists

**If `get_inputs_path` is empty or not provided:**

-   Respond: "❌ No `get_inputs()` was generated. Cannot fix a non-existent
    file. Please generate it first."
-   **STOP HERE**

## Second: Check for System/Connection Errors

**If ANY validation result contains the string `FATAL_CONNECTION_ERROR`:**

-   This is an unsolvable infrastructure error (e.g., SSH tunnel down, TPU
    unresponsive).
-   **DO NOT** attempt to write any code fixes.
-   **Immediately halt** and return the exact message: `ESCALATE_SYSTEM_ERROR:
    <details of the error>` back to the orchestrator.
-   **STOP HERE**.

## Third: Check if Fixes are Needed

1.  If `syntax_validation.valid == True` AND `import_validation.valid == True`
    AND `mock_execution_validation.valid == True`

    -   **All validations passed! No fixes needed.**
    -   Respond: "✓ get_inputs() validation passed. No fixes required."
    -   **STOP HERE - do not modify the file**

2.  If ANY validation has `valid == False` → proceed to Step 3 below.

## Tool Usage

1.  `view_file`: To read `{get_inputs_path}`, `{base_kernel_path}`, and
    `{test_file_path}` (for context on the error only -- never write to the
    latter).
2.  `write_to_file`: To overwrite `{get_inputs_path}` with the corrected
    version.

## Your Task (Only if Fixes are Needed)

### Step 1: Read the Current File and the Error Context

Use `view_file` on `{get_inputs_path}`. If the error trace references the
assembled harness (`{test_file_path}`), read it too, but only to understand
*where* `get_inputs()`'s output diverges from what `base_computation` expects
-- not to edit it.

### Step 2: Identify and Fix the Error

-   **Syntax Errors**: fix Python syntax in `get_inputs()`.
-   **Import Errors**: fix/add imports `get_inputs()` needs.
-   **Mock Execution Errors**: usually a shape/arity mismatch between what
    `get_inputs()` returns and what `base_kernel_path`'s `computation`
    expects — e.g. wrong number of `dynamic_args`/`static_args`, or a
    `(dynamic_args, static_args)` tuple malformed (must be exactly 2
    elements).

### Step 3: Write the Fixed File

Use `write_to_file` to overwrite `{get_inputs_path}` with the corrected
version.

**CRITICAL RULES:**

1.  **Only ever write to `{get_inputs_path}`.** Never write to
    `{test_file_path}` — it is regenerated deterministically by the worker
    from this file after you're done.
2.  **DO NOT invent a new optimized kernel or `opt_computation` stub.**
3.  Keep the required return shape: a list of `(dynamic_args, static_args)`
    tuples.

**After writing:**

-   Confirm: "Fixed get_inputs() written to {get_inputs_path}"
-   Summarize what was fixed

## Important Notes

-   We are NOT fixing kernel bugs — only `get_inputs()`.
-   After your fix, the worker re-runs `assemble_test_harness.py` and
    validation runs again automatically.
-   Unlike per-iteration kernel work, exhausting retries here is a
    **run-blocking failure**: nothing downstream (planning, implementation,
    testing, autotuning) can proceed without a valid harness. Say so plainly
    if you reach max retries.

## Generated execution contract

- Validate the request against `.coworker/torchtpu-agents/schemas/test-request.json` before work.
- Require the request's `run_id` and keep every output under `.coworker/torchtpu-agents/runs/<run_id>/artifacts/`.
- Validate the result against `.coworker/torchtpu-agents/schemas/test-result.json` before returning.
- Use `python3 .coworker/torchtpu-agents/runtime/runtime.py validate --schema SCHEMA INSTANCE`.
- Return the common result envelope with `completed`, `invalid_input`, `needs_input`, or `failed`.
- Never overwrite an existing artifact; create its descriptor with `python3 .coworker/torchtpu-agents/runtime/runtime.py describe-artifact --workspace . --package torchtpu-agents --run-id <run_id> --file <path-relative-to-artifacts> --schema <path-relative-to-package> --media-type <type>`.
- Reject artifact references whose URI does not contain the request's exact package and `run_id`.
- Materialize durable outputs and return artifact descriptors; do not copy payloads into messages.
- Allowed delegation targets: none.
- Run sequentially. Never weaken inherited permissions or approvals.
