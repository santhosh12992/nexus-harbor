"""Deterministically applies an autotuning best_config to a kernel file.

Replaces `apply_best_config_agent` (an LLM agent that read the autotune spec
and results, then rewrote the kernel by hand). Substituting `{PLACEHOLDER}`
values back into a code template is a mechanical string operation, so it is
done here as plain code instead of asking a model to transcribe values -- the
same fix applied upstream to ApplyBestConfigAgent (it stopped being a
CustomLlmAgent and became a plain deterministic step).

# also matches incidental code that happens to look the same, e.g. an
# f-string "f'{x}'" or a one-element set literal "{x}" -- lowercase variable

# survives substitution untouched and only fails later, as a NameError, when
